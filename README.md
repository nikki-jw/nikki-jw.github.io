## Purpose

The purpose of creating this portfolio was showcase what I've learnt thus far in HTML and CSS.
This portfolio was created with potential employers and collaborators in mind, in hopes of attracting future oppertunities 
by inserting my a bit of my personality, current skills and style into this portfolio.

## Functionality and Features

Background Images
Each background image features a bunny and yellow background. Each image varies slightly depending what page is displaying on the browser.
These back ground images were downloaded from Adobe Stock Images: https://stock.adobe.com/au/

### Navigation Bar
Located on the top right of each HTML page is a navigations bar which helps the user to navigate to different pages of the portfolio and external sites.

### Resume
A PDF resume is downloadable from the portfolio using the 'Resume' tab located in the navigation bar.

### Socials Bar
On the bottom left of the page is a 'socials bar' which is comprimised of clickable logos which lead the user to social media accounts.

### The Coder Academy
On the index page, upon hovering over "The Coder Academy", the users mouse changes and the text enlargens. Purposely overexagerated this is to adivse the user that this is a clockable link which leads the user to: https://coderacademy.edu.au/

## Responsive Design
Using CSS flexbox and media queries users are able to access the portfolio through different devices without comprimising the portoflios integerity.

For devices under 600px the background image is no longer displayed. In stead only displaying a 'yellow' colour of the same shade.
